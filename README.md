This project is a webinterface that runs KaSim models and displays the results.

Building from source and running examples
-----------------------------------------

To build from source:
Install [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)
Make sure that KaSim is in your system path and can be run by "KaSim" command.
Type the following commands:
```scala
$ sbt // to open sbt console
$ re-start // will open akka-http application with examples
```
It will open a local version of kappa-notebook at http://localhost:1234/
