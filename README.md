I am starting to develop a web-interface for dealing with kappa models. It will be used 

Building from source and running examples
-----------------------------------------

To build from source:
Install [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)
Type the following commands:
```scala
$ sbt // to open sbt console
$ re-start // will open akka-http application with examples
```          
It will open a local version of kappa-notebook at http://localhost:1234/
