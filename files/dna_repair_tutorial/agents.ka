#The model’s contact map: agents figure together with their sites and the potential
#values held by these sites (only TDG and DNA have sites holding values). Potential
#bindings are represented by edges.

#Domains and interactions of CBP: the fine domain structure of CBP is far
#richer than what we will represent in our model (§2.3).
